# Welcome to Sqooler

*Sqooler* is a [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) based SDK that allows you to receive jobs for quantum quantum hardware in a reliable fashion. It is therefore meant for the developer and quantum hardware owner who wants to provide a cloud access to their code in a secure fashion. A few important features:

- The PC never has to grant access privileges to any outside contributor.
- The remote jobs are heavily controlled through [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/).
- Simple setup through templates.
